# RandomCityNames-Content
This is a central location to store available word sets for the RandomCityNames mod for Cities Skylines. If you would like to add different flavours of generation you can follow the methods taken to add the English variants (See settings.json and english.json). 

The mod downloads these files and stores them in %localappdata%\Colossal Order\Cities_Skylines\RandomCityNames. Create a Pull Request to add your custom language sets which will then be available for all of those using the mod.
